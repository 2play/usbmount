usbmount
--------

The usbmount package automatically mounts USB mass storage devices
(typically USB pens) when they are plugged in, and unmounts them when
they are removed. The mountpoints (/media/usb[0-7] by default),
filesystem types to consider, and mount options are configurable. When
multiple devices are plugged in, the first available mountpoint is
automatically selected.

If the device provides a model name, a symlink /var/usbmount/MODELNAME
pointing to the mountpoint is automatically created.

The comments in the configuration file /etc/usbmount.conf describe how
to configure the package.
